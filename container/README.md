## Tools

### Text Editor
[Micro][] is chosen instead of [Vim][] or other classical text editors because it is very friendly to inexperienced users, and powerful enough for experienced users.

### Markdown Viewer
A decent text editor can already show markdown files nicely. However, a viewer can avoid accidental modification of the original file from inexperienced users. It can also hide control marks from them to reduce confusion.

There are many terminal based markdown viewers. [mdv][] is chosen because it can be easily installed through [pip][]. Since we already choose quite some [Python][] tools, most prerequisites of [mdv][] should have been fulfilled. Adding [mdv][] won't change the image size a lot.
