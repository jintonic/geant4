# X and Gamma-ray interactions

X and gamma-rays interact with matter mainly through three processes:

- [Photoelectric effect][] (Geant4 name: **phot**)
- [Compton scattering][] (Geant4 name: **compt**)
- [Pair production][] (Geant4 name: **conv**)

The following plot shows their relative significance in aluminum in different energy ranges. At low energy, the photoelectric effect is dominent. Around MeV, Compton scattering is dominent. Above 10 MeV, pair production is dominent.
