Elemental compositions of common body parts are available in [Geant4][] as [NIST compounds][]. For example, `G4_ADIPOSE_TISSUE_ICRP` is for body fat, and `G4_BONE_COMPACT_ICRU` for the hard outer layer of bones, etc. If you need information for a specific body part that is not in Geant4, please refer to chapter "13. ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION OF BODY TISSUES" in [ICRP][] publication [89][], or [ICRU][] report [64][].
