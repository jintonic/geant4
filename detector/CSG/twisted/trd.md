A trapezoid twisted along z-axis can be constructed using [C++][] or some [simple text](../..):

```cpp
volu twisted TWISTEDTRD
 30 // Half x-length at the surface at -dz/2 [mm]
 10 // Half x-length at the surface at +dz/2 [mm]
 40 // Half y-length at the surface at -dz/2 [mm]
 15 // Half y-length at the surface at +dz/2 [mm]
 60 // Half z length: dz/2 [mm]
 30*degree // angle twisted
 G4_WATER // material
```

> **NOTE**!
>
> - The default unit of the twist angle here is *rad*, not *degree*. We need to explicitly multiply the number with `degree` if we want to use *degree* as the unit. This is different from untwisted shapes, where the default unit of an angle is already *degree*.
> - The twist must be within Â±(0, 90) degree (not including 0 and 90 degrees).
 
The full source code is in [trd.tg][], which can be visualized using the macro file [trd.mac][], assuming an [universal Geant4 application][], such as [MinGLE][] or [GEARS][], is available:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jintonic/geant4
cd geant4/detector/CSG/twisted
# generate animated picture, trd.gif
./twist.sh
# or launch a UI
gears
# in the UI, run
/control/execute trd.mac
```
