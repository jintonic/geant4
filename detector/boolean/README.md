[Boolean][] operations are ways to combine simple geometries into complex ones.

> **Note**
> There is no need to use [Boolean][] operation to dig a hole inside a larger volume in order to place a smaller one inside the larger one. Placing a small volume directly inside a larger one won't create overlapping. Instead, the smaller volume becomes a daughter volume of the larger one, and its material replaces that of the larger one.
