# Parameterisation

[Geant4][] basic example [B2b][] demonstrates how to place a series of similar volumes with slight difference along a line in C++. Parameterized placement of a series of volumes does exist in pure [text description][] of Geant4 geometry. However, it only allows the placement of the same volume multiple times without any change of the volume itself, while in [B2b][], the size of the volume increases with each placement.

A simple `for` loop in the [SHELL][] script [detector.sh][] is used to achieve the same parameterised placement done with C++ in [B2b][]. Due to its simple syntax, the text description of Geant4 geomtry can be generated by your favorate scripting langurages, such as [SHELL][], or [Python][], which makes it even more versatile than C++.
