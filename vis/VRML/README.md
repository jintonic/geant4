# VRML

The [VRML][] visualization driver is available in any [Geant4][] installation. It is used to generate files, `g4_??.wrl`, which can be viewed online with [Shine][], or using an external program, such as [ParaView][], [castle model viewer][] (formerly *view3dscene*, not available for Macs with Apple silicon chips), [3D builder][] (Windows App), [ORBISNAP][] (not available for Macs with Apple silicon chips), [FreeWRL][] (not available for Macs with Apple silicon chips), [OpenVRML][] (10 years old!), etc., or be converted to its succeeder [X3D][], which can be viewed directly in a modern web browser that supports WebGL.

## Example

[detector.tg][] describes the model in the basic Geant4 example [B1][]. [mingle.mac][] and [gears.mac][] can be used by [MinGLE][] and [GEARS][], respectively, to generate `g4_??.wrl` from [detector.tg][].

```sh
# assume mingle is available in your PATH
mingle mingle.mac
# assume gears is available in your PATH
gears gears.mac
```

## Limitations

[VRML][] doesn't show texts. The following macro commands do not work (at least not fully) in [VRML][].

```sh
/vis/scene/add/date
/vis/scene/add/text
/vis/scene/add/text2D
/vis/scene/add/logo2D
/vis/scene/add/eventID
/vis/scene/add/axes  # axes show, but without label and color
/vis/scene/add/scale # scale shows, but without label
```

The command to generate a 3D G4 logo ([/vis/scene/add/logo][]) works because the logo is made of two 3D objects.

The color of a volume specified by [/vis/geometry/set/colour][] `volumeName ! 0.3 0.6 0.7 0.3` is saved in `g4_??.wrl`, but the opacity setting is not, because the opacity of a volume can normally be tuned in a [VRML][] viewer.

Colors of trajectories are saved in `g4_??.wrl`. They can be shown correctly in some [VRML][] viewers. However, their color settings are not obeyed in the wireframe mode in a [VRML][] viewer.

A volume turned off by [/vis/geometry/set/visibility][] `volumeName ! false` will not be saved in `g4_??.wrl`.

Setting [/vis/viewer/set/style][] `surface/wireframe/cloud` is not saved in `g4_??.wrl`. But they can be toggled in a [VRML][] viewer.

Settings related to viewpoint or orientations seem to have no effect, because they can be changed in a [VRML][] viewer.
