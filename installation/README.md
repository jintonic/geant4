[Geant4][] libraries are available in various formats:

1. pre-compiled libraries that run on the cloud or computer clusters. No local compilation or installation is needed. This is the easiest, but not available for everybody.
2. pre-compiled libraries shipped together with the containerized operating system where they were compiled. They are ready to be used locally without any compilation and installation process. However, this requires a user understand how to use containerized software.
3. pre-compiled libraries on very specific operating systems.  No lengthy and error-prone compilation is needed, only installation (copy files to specific folders) is needed. This works best for [Windows](windows) users, not so much for Linux or Mac users.
4. source code. It must be compiled and installed locally for different operating systems. It requires some [basic understanding of how to compile and use a C++ program](cpp).
